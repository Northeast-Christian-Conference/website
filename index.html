            <span>
              The Northeast Christian Conference has been held during the 
              Columbus Day Weekend on the grounds of the Harvey Cedars 
              Bible Conference on New Jersey's Long Beach Island for a 
              number of years. The conference is sponsored by Christians 
              from several northeast areas with the desire to seek the 
              Lord together as His people and to come to a fuller knowledge 
              of Him.
